After the release of Wasmer 1.0, we are thrilled to announce the
immediate availability of [the Wasmer Python embedding 1.0
version](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python).

Time flies! It’s been a little bit less than 2 years since we first
released `wasmer`, the Wasmer embedding for Python. Thanks to a
vibrant and awesome community, this project has been greatly welcomed!
After 1.8 million installations in the wild, it’s our great pleasure
to introduce the 1.0 version with a stable API, lightning
performances, cross-compilation, three compilers, two engines, and
many more advanced features. Let’s dig in!

### Light by default

By default, the
[`wasmer`](https://pypi.org/project/wasmer/)
package comes as _light_ as possible, the rest are opt-in
features. `wasmer` provides by default:

- the entire Wasmer runtime,
- 2 headless engines.

What’s an engine? An _engine_ is responsible to drive the
_compilation_ from a WebAssembly module to executable code, and the
_execution_ of this executable code. Note that the engine is also
responsible to store the executable code somewhere, along with
serializing and deserializing it when caching the compilation
result. The Wasmer Python embedding comes with the _JIT engine_
(`wasmer.engine.JIT`, the default) and the _Native engine_
(`wasmer.engine.Native`).

In a nutshell, the JIT engine stores the executable code in memory,
whilst the Native engine stores the executable code in a native shared
library object (`.so`, `.dylib` or `.dll` files depending on the
Operating System where it runs).

Because the `wasmer` package comes with zero compilers, the engines
are said _headless_. In other words, the engines aren’t able to
compile, they can only execute an already-compiled WebAssembly module.

Why headless engines are the default? Because it’s super light, and
it’s the common path. The `wasmer` wheel is around 1.5Mb without the
compilers, or around 15Mb with all of them. It obviously impacts the
startup time, and the required space in memory. It also makes it
possible to fit `wasmer` in very small boards (thinking of the
Internet of Things). Or more basically, it speeds up installation and
setup. See a graph below comparing all the wheel sizes.

### Pick your best compiler on the fly

As we said in the previous section, the `wasmer` package comes with
headless engines. What if we want to compile a WebAssembly module to
executable code? Then we need to install a compiler. We provide 3 of
them as standalone packages:

1. [`wasmer-compiler-singlepass`](https://pypi.org/project/wasmer-compiler-singlepass/),
   the Singlepass compiler provides a super fast compilation time, and
   a slower execution time. It is not prone to JIT-bombs. It’s _ideal
   for blockchains_.
2. [`wasmer-compiler-cranelift`](https://pypi.org/project/wasmer-compiler-cranelift/),
   the Cranelift compiler provides a fast compilation time, and a fast
   execution time. It’s _ideal for development_.
3. [`wasmer-compiler-llvm`](https://pypi.org/project/wasmer-compiler-llvm/),
   the LLVM compiler provides a slow compilation time, but a very fast
   execution time, close to native. It’s _ideal for production_.

An example is worth a thousand words.

```python
# Import types from the `wasmer` package.
# Also import one compiler, here Cranelift.
from wasmer import engine, Store, Module, Instance
from wasmer_compiler_cranelift import Compiler

# Let's define the store, that holds the engine, that holds the compiler.
store = Store(engine.JIT(Compiler))

# Let's compile and instantiate the module.
module = Module(store, open('my_program.wasm', 'rb').read())
instance = Instance(module)

# Call the exported `sum` function naturally.
result = instance.exports.sum(5, 37)

assert result == 42
```

Notice how everything fits together nicely. Now let’s imagine we have
serialized the compiled module into a file as such:

```python
serialized_module_file.write(module.serialize())
```

One can simply execute the WebAssembly compiled-module with no
compiler, only with a headless engine as follows:

```python
# Import types from the `wasmer` package.
from wasmer import engine, Store, Instance, Module

store = Store(engine.JIT()) # we don't pass a compiler!

# Deserialize the compiled WebAssembly module, and instantiate it.
module = Module.deserialize(store, serialized_module_file.read())
instance = Instance(module)

result = instance.exports.sum(1, 2)

assert result == 3
```

_Et voilà !_ It works with no compiler this time.

**We believe that this flexibility is a game changer since it can
address everyone’s needs while keeping the Wasmer runtime light and
fast.**

#### LLVM infrastructure just for you, pypi

A (funny?) side note we wanted to share. We did write, from scratch,
[an entire build system to produce custom LLVM
builds](https://github.com/wasmerio/llvm-custom-builds) specifically
designed for pypi. Indeed, the default LLVM pre-builts provided by the
LLVM project themselves aren’t compatible with pypi binary wheels policy. The most
geeky of you might want to take a look at it: it’s really simple but
so useful. Feel free to fork the project.

#### Wheel size

A wheel is a Python package. It’s what a user downloads and installs
when running `pip install wasmer` for example.

We thought it would be interesting to see how light the wheels are
now. To do that, we have fetch the size of the:

- `wasmer` wheel alone (with headless engines),
- `wasmer` + `wasmer-compiler-singlepass` wheels,
- `wasmer` + `wasmer-compiler-cranelift` wheels,
- `wasmer` + `wasmer-compiler-llvm` wheels.

We have computed those sizes for 3 platforms (macOS, Linux, and
Windows) and 2 architectures (`amd64` and `aarch64`). (On Linux
`aarch64`, the `wasmer-compiler-singlepass` wheel is missing because
it does not support (yet) `aarch64`. On Windows `amd64`, the
`wasmer-compiler-llvm` wheel is missing due to a temporary issue, it
should be fixed quickly.)

The results are presented in the following graph:

<figure>
  <a href="/images/graph-wheel-size.png" target="_blank" title="Open the image at full size">
    <img src="/images/graph-wheel-size.png" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>Size of wheels (in Mb); lower is better.</figcatpion>
</figure>

On average, the `wasmer` wheel has a size of 1.4Mb; the `wasmer` +
`wasmer-compiler-singlepass` wheels have a size of 2Mb; the
`wasmer` + `wasmer-compiler-cranelift` wheels have a size of 2.8Mb;
the `wasmer` + `wasmer-compiler-llvm` wheels have a size of 13Mb.

### Improved and simplified API

Between the 0.4 and the 1.0 version, we have rewritten the entire
project with a new, improved API. The new API is as close as possible
to the Wasmer runtime API (the original one, written in Rust), so that
it reduces the cognitive effort for new users to switch from one
project to another.

All the WebAssembly externals are now supported, which includes
`Function`, `Global`, `Memory`, and `Table`. All of them can be used
as imports or as exports. Well, this is now straighforward.

To simplify the declaration of imports, we provide an `ImportObject`
API. It works as follows:

````python
from wasmer import engine, wat2wasm, Store, Module, ImportObject, Function, FunctionType, Type, Instance
from wasmer_compiler_cranelift import Compiler

# Let's declare the Wasm module with the text representation.
# If this module was written in Rust, it would have been:
#
# ```rs
# extern "C" {
#     fn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32;
# }
#
# #[no_mangle]
# pub extern "C" fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
#     unsafe { sum(x, 1) }
# }
# ```
wasm_bytes = wat2wasm(
    """
    (module
      (import "env" "sum" (func $sum (param i32 i32) (result i32)))
      (func (export "add_one") (param $x i32) (result i32)
        local.get $x
        i32.const 1
        call $sum))
    """
)

# Create a store.
store = Store(engine.JIT(Compiler))

# Let's compile the WebAssembly module.
module = Module(store, wasm_bytes)

# When creating an `Instance`, we can pass an `ImportObject`. All
# entities that must be imported are registered inside the
# `ImportObject`.
import_object = ImportObject()

# Let's write the Python function that is going to be imported,
# i.e. called by the WebAssembly module.
def sum(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y

# The type of `sum` is infered from the Python declaration.
# It can be specified as the third argument of `Function`
# otherwise (see the documentation).
sum_host_function = Function(store, sum)

# Now let's register the `sum` import inside the `env` namespace.
import_object.register(
    "env",
    {
        "sum": sum_host_function,
    }
)

# Let's instantiate the module!
instance = Instance(module, import_object)

# And finally, call the `add_one` exported function!
assert instance.exports.add_one(41) == 42
````

Again, this is straighforward and brings no surprise. This is one new
feature amongst many others.

### Faster memory operations

The `Memory` class (which represents an imported or an exported
memory) provided views, which were classes like `Uint8View`,
`Int8View`, etc. up to `Int32View`, through the `memory.uint8_view()`
method and siblings. These view classes were useful to read from and
write into a WebAssembly memory. Even if those operations weren’t
slow, they could be faster. Let’s introduce `Buffer`! A buffer is
generated by the `memory.buffer` getter. It implements the [Python
buffer protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html), so it
is possible to read and write bytes with the
[`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes),
[`bytearray`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray),
or
[`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview)
standard functions.

Here is quick benchmark to show how the `Buffer` improves performance
when reading 1 and 255 bytes from memory (the lower the better):

<figure>
  <a href="/images/graph-memory-read.png" target="_blank" title="Open the image at full size">
    <img src="/images/graph-memory-read.png" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>Reading 1 and 255 bytes in memory (in ns).</figcaption>
</figure>

When reading 1 byte, views are 2 times slower than `Buffer` with
`memoryview` or `bytearray`. When reading 255 bytes, views are 16
times slower than `Buffer`. We consider this result as a
non-negligible improvement.

### Cross-compilation

The compilers come with a great feature: They support
_cross-compilation_. It means that from an `amd64` (`x86_64`), we can
compile for an `aarch64` (`ARM64`) machine, or from Linux to macOS
etc. For example:

```python
from wasmer import engine, target, Store, Module

# Let's define the target “triple”. Historically, such things had
# three fields, though additional fields have been added over time.
triple = target.Triple('x86_64-linux-musl')

# Let's define the CPU features.
cpu_features = target.CpuFeatures()
cpu_features.add('sse2')

# Let's build the target!
target = target.Target(triple, cpu_features)

# And now, let's define the store with its engine.
store = Store(engine.JIT(Compiler, target))

# Finally, compile the WebAssembly module for this target.
module = Module(store, wasm_byte)

assert isinstance(module, Module)
```

What’s next? Serialize and send your WebAssembly compiled module on
its host mate, where a potentially Wasmer with headless engines is
waiting despairingly.

**We believe that cross-compilation will help users to pre-compile
their WebAssembly modules on a robust dedicated machine, and then
deploy them in various environments like a breath.**

### WASI

The `wasmer` package now features [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) (The
WebAssembly System Interface), with all the snapshot previews;
understand, all the versions.

Basically, the `wasi` sub-package helps to configure an `ImportObject`
object that is passed to `Instance`. Let’s see how it works with an
example. We want to execute [this Rust
program](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python/blob/f79df46c09317db97e1577a22e8da9696fd427c7/tests/wasi.rs),
that prints its arguments, its environment variables, and that lists
the content of its current working directory.

```python
from wasmer import engine, wasi, Store, Module, ImportObject, Instance
from wasmer_compiler_cranelift import Compiler

# As usual, let's fetch some bytes and compile the module.
wasm_bytes = open('wasi.wasm', 'rb').read()
store = Store(engine.JIT(Compiler))
module = Module(store, wasm_bytes)

# First, let's extract the WASI version from the module. Why? Because
# WASI exists in multiple versions, and it doesn't work the
# same way. So, to ensure compatibility, we need to know the version.
wasi_version = wasi.get_version(module, strict=True)

# Second, create a `wasi.Environment`. It contains everything related
# to WASI. To build such an environment, we must use the
# `wasi.StateBuilder`.
#
# In this case, we specify the program name: `wasi_test_program`. We
# also specify the program is invoked with the `--test` argument, in
# addition to two environment variables: `COLOR` and
# `APP_SHOULD_LOG`. Finally, we map the `the_host_current_dir` to the
# current directory. There it is:
wasi_env =
    wasi.StateBuilder('wasi_test_program'). \
        argument('--test'). \
        environment('COLOR', 'true'). \
        environment('APP_SHOULD_LOG', 'false'). \
        map_directory('the_host_current_dir', '.'). \
        finalize()

# From the WASI environment, we generate a custom import object. Why?
# Because WASI is, from the user perspective, a bunch of
# imports. Consequently `generate_import_object`… generates a
# pre-configured import object.
#
# Do you remember when we said WASI has multiple versions? Well, we
# need the WASI version here!
import_object = wasi_env.generate_import_object(store, wasi_version)

# Now we can instantiate the module.
instance = Instance(module, import_object)

# The entry point for a WASI WebAssembly module is a function named
# `_start`. Let's call it and see what happens!
instance.exports._start()
```

This program aboves prints the following data on `stdout`:

```
Found program name: `wasi_test_program`
Found 1 arguments: --test
Found 2 environment variables: COLOR=true, APP_SHOULD_LOG=false
Found 1 preopened directories: DirEntry("/the_host_current_dir")
```

3 instructions and WASI is configured, neat!

### Ready to use on major platforms and architectures

One of the promises of WebAssembly is its _universality_. By design,
it aims at being run anywhere.

To fulfill this promise, we provide more than _57 wheels_ for various
platforms and architectures, including Linux, Darwin (macOS) and
Windows, and `amd64` (Intel) along with `aarch64` (ARM). All our
packages work with Python 3.6 up to 3.9.

### Documentation and examples

We take pride in making our projects really polished. As we did with
the previous releases, we spent a lot of time polishing the user
experience.

We have written [extensive documentation for our
users](https://wasmerio.github.io/wasmer-python/api/wasmer/). It
contains more than 50 examples, all of them illustrating how to use
specific functions or classes. We focused on providing comfortable
navigation in documentation for beginners, with hints and useful
links. All the examples can be copy-pasted into a Python shell, and
they will all work as is.

In addition to this documentation, we provide [a set of more detailed
examples](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python/tree/792eef3bbd0dedfb2168e256be878e370b165dee/examples). A
document lists and explains all of them. One can search by keywords to
find appropriate examples faster. Every example is extensively
documented to explain every detail to the user.

**We believe this kind of documentation and examples will help users
to get onboard and be familiar with WebAssembly more quickly.**

### Discovering compiler capabilities with a benchmark

Designing benchmarks is hard, so we designed a benchmark that only
shows why we provide multiple compilers and engines. The benchmark
illustrates how the compilers address different needs when the balance
between compilation-time or execution-time varies.

Because benchmarks are not our best way to party, we tried to make
them fun. The idea is to execute JavaScript inside Python, via
`wasmer` and [QuickJS](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs/) compiled
as a WebAssembly module
([`qjs.wasm`](https://wapm.io/package/quickjs)). We don’t execute
something fancy, just `console.log('hello')`. Because too much fun is
not always good.

Benchmarks are run inside an Ubuntu virtual machine, with 4 CPU cores
and 4Gb of memory; the host has an Intel Xeon CPU (3.10Ghz). It’s not
really important for what we are going to illustrate.

So first, let’s compile the 2.4Mb `qjs.wasm` WebAssembly module with
our Singlepass, Cranelift and LLVM compilers. Times are given in
microseconds (μs).

<figure>
  <a href="/images/graph-compilation.png" target="_blank" title="Open the image at full size">
    <img src="/images/graph-compilation.png" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>Create a <code>Module</code> with the JIT engine + the
  Cranelift, LLVM and Singlepass compilers (in μs).</figcaption>
</figure>

The results are the following. `wasmer` with the Singlepass compiler
is the fastest to compile `qjs.wasm` in 102ms. `wasmer` with the
Cranelift compiler is the second in 295ms. Finally `wasmer` with the
LLVM compiler in 5252ms (5sec).

We can’t conclude anything based on that, except that if a compiler
takes time, it’s likely because it optimises the generated code
heavily, which could mean that the execution time will be improved.

Because it’s expensive to compile a module into executable code, we
want to cache it. And compilation should ideally be always done
once. So let’s measure how long it takes to get a `Module` from a
pre-compiled WebAssembly module. We want to see if there is a
difference between a module that has been compiled with the
Singlepass, Cranelift or LLVM compiler. We are going to use a headless
engine here, so the `wasmer` package alone with no compiler.

<figure>
  <a href="/images/graph-headless.png" target="_blank" title="Open the image at full size">
    <img src="/images/graph-headless.png" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>Create a <code>Module</code> with the JIT headless
  engine (module is pre-compiled) (in μs).</figcaption>
</figure>

The results are the following. `wasmer` with the LLVM compiler is the
fastest to rebuild a `Module` from a pre-compiled module in 9.8ms,
following by  — head-to-head — `wasmer` with the Cranelift and the
Singlepass compilers in 11.5ms.

That result is interesting. LLVM is the slower compiler to compile a
WebAssembly module, but once compiled it’s faster to load the module!
That’s a good news.

Take a breath. Up to now, we have successfully compiled `qjs.wasm` to
executable code. So let’s use it! As we said, we are going to execute
`console.log('hello')`. It requires WASI, so it’s a nice real-world
test. Let’s see how they perform.

<figure>
  <a href="/images/graph-execution.png" target="_blank" title="Open the image at full size">
    <img src="/images/graph-execution.png" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>Executing <code>console.log("hello")</code> with
  <code>qjs.wasm</code>, compiled with the Cranelift, LLVM and
  Singlepass compilers (in μs).</figcaption>
</figure>

First, `wasmer` is successfully able to print `hello` on the standard
output. This string was printed by JavaScript, through WebAssembly,
inside Python. How fun is that :-)?

Second, we see interesting results. `wasmer` with the LLVM compiler is
by far the faster to execute `qjs.wasm`. It was compile-time well
spent! It prints `hello` in JavaScript in 0.219ms. `wasmer` with the
Cranelift compiler prints `hello` in 0.485ms. Finally, `wasmer` with
the Singlepass compiler prints `hello` in 0.560ms. It’s very likely
that a more computation intensive test would uncover the difference
between Cranelift and Singlepass deeper.

This benchmark confirms what we said earlier:

- The Singlepass compiler provides a fast compilation but a slower
  execution, which can be perfect for small/simple WebAssembly
  modules,
- The Cranelift compiler provides a good balance between compilation
  and execution time,
- The LLVM compiler provides a slow but optimised compilation, and a
  very fast execution, which is perfect for complex WebAssembly modules.

The fact that `wasmer` comes with headless engines (with no compiler)
is helpful, as rebuilding a `Module` from a pre-compiled module is
really useful.

In the case of `wasmer` with an already pre-compiled module with the
LLVM compiler, it takes 9.8ms for the full startup + 0.2ms for the
execution, for a total of 10ms to print `hello`.

### Conclusion

The 1.0 version testifies of an API and features stability and
maturity. We believe that the new design with the two headless
engines, and the compilers as standalone packages, is a great
improvement and provides more flexibility. It allows installing
`wasmer` in more devices.

With the help of the new cross-compilation API, we believe that it’s
easier than ever to execute WebAssembly anywhere.

Performance has been improved. WASI is now supported, up to the latest
version (up to `wasi_snapshot_preview1` at the time of writing).

Documentation and examples have been meticulously written to help
users new to WebAssembly, or to help advanced users. We believe it
will facilitate the usage of WebAssembly in the Python ecosystem.

#### What’s next?

Nonetheless, the `wasmer` Python package does not cover all the latest
WebAssembly features (for example, [the multi-value
proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value) is implemented,
but [the reference type
proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types) is still
under implementation). Be reassured though, it’s very likely that your
usual compiler (like `rustc`) does not support those in-progress
proposals yet, so it’s not a blocker. But we still have work!

#### Test it!

The packages are available on pypi:

- [`wasmer`](https://pypi.org/project/wasmer/),
- [`wasmer-compiler-cranelift`](https://pypi.org/project/wasmer-compiler-cranelift/),
- [`wasmer-compiler-llvm`](https://pypi.org/project/wasmer-compiler-llvm/),
- [`wasmer-compiler-singlepass`](https://pypi.org/project/wasmer-compiler-singlepass/).

Wheels for `aarch64` aren’t published on pypi (because it doesn’t
fulfill [the `manylinux2010` policy regarding binary wheels, see the
PEP
571](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/#the-manylinux2010-policy)). They
are freely downloadable from [the Github
release](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python/releases/tag/1.0.0).
