We are delighted to announce the release of [Wasmer Go embedding 1.0
version](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go).

About 1.5 years ago we first released `wasmer-go`, the Wasmer
embedding for Go. The reception by the community was beyond our
expectations, the response to our launch of [the fastest WebAssembly
runtime for
Go](https://medium.com/wasmer/announcing-the-fastest-webassembly-runtime-for-go-wasmer-19832d77c050)
was a great way to start! A community of more than 1,300 people gives
us the energy to push this project further. We have seen many users
from various domains that weren't anticipated. After hundreds of
thousands of installations, it's our great pleasure to introduce the
1.0 version, fully rewritten to provide a stable and complete API,
better performance, cross-compilation, two compilers, two engines, and
many more advanced features!

## Improved and simplified API

We have entirely rewritten the project with a new, improved API. All
the WebAssembly externals are now supported, which includes
`Function`, `Global`, `Memory`, and `Table`. All of them can be used
as imports or as exports. Well, now that's straightforward.

The `ImportObject` API is now unified and simplified (previously, we
had 2 distinct API for historical reasons).

An example is worth a thousand words. Let's consider the following
example to illustrate many of the improvements:

```go
import "github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/wasmer"

// Create an engine. It's responsible for driving the compilation and the
// execution of a WebAssembly module.
engine := wasmer.NewEngine()

// Create a store, that holds the engine.
store := wasmer.NewStore(engine)

// Create a new module from some WebAssembly in its text representation
// (for the sake of simplicity of the example).
module, _ := wasmer.NewModule(
	store,
	[]byte(`
		(module
		  ;; We import a math.sum function.
		  (import "math" "sum" (func $sum (param i32 i32) (result i32)))

		  ;; We export an add_one function.
		  (func (export "add_one") (param $x i32) (result i32)
		    local.get $x
		    i32.const 1
		    call $sum))
	`),
)

// Let's create a new host function for `math.sum`.
function := wasmer.NewFunction(
	store,

	// The function signature.
	wasmer.NewFunctionType(
		// Parameters.
		wasmer.NewValueTypes(wasmer.I32, wasmer.I32),
		// Results.
		wasmer.NewValueTypes(wasmer.I32)
	),

	// The function implementation.
	func(args []wasmer.Value) ([]wasmer.Value, error) {
		x := args[0].I32()
		y := args[1].I32()

		return []wasmer.Value{wasmer.NewI32(x + y)}, nil
	},
)

// Let's use the new `ImportObject` API…
importObject := wasmer.NewImportObject()

// … to register the `math.sum` function.
importObject.Register(
	"math",
	map[string]wasmer.IntoExtern{
		"sum": function,
	},
)

// Finally, let's instantiate the module, with all the imports.
instance, _ := wasmer.NewInstance(module, importObject)

// And let's call the `add_one` function!
addOne, _ := instance.Exports.GetFunction("add_one")

result, _ := addOne(41)

assert(result, int32(42))
```

A couple of interesting things can be seen here:

1. There is an `Engine` API — more about this in the next section,

2. Host functions are fully implemented in Go; `cgo` is no longer
   necessary when declaring host functions. Moreover, host functions
   no longer receive the famous `context` argument — more on that in a
   second,

3. Host functions can return multiple-values,

4. Host functions can return any error _à la_ Go,

5. The `ImportObject` API allows to register a collection of
   “externals”: `Function`, `Memory` etc., i.e. any type that
   implements the `IntoExtern` interface, to a given namespace (here
   `math`),
6. The `Exports` API allows to read any kinds of exports, including
   multiple memories.

The entire API is more idiomatic, and very much simpler to use from
our perspective.

### A word about host functions

Previously, a host function had to be declared with a `cgo` mapping:

```go
// extern int32_t sum(void *context, int32_t x, int32_t y);
import "C"

//export sum
func sum(context unsafe.Pointer, x int32, y int32) int32 {
	return x + y
}
```

Now, host functions no longer need `cgo`. That's a big user-experience
improvement! A host function can be any Go function or Go lambda
function.

Also, host functions can now return errors, which was impossible
before. It will automatically translate to a WebAssembly trap (with
the new `Trap` API).

Finally, host functions receive and return slices of values, i.e. it
supports multi-values!

```go
func sum(args []wasmer.Value) ([]wasmer.Value, error) {
	x := args[0].I32()
	y := args[1].I32()

	return []wasmer.Value{wasmer.NewI32(x + y)}, nil
}
```

Note that host functions manipulate values of type `Value` to allow a
more unified API.

Continuing on the subject of implementing host functions, to create a
proper host function, we use the `NewFunction` function. It is also
possible to create a new host function with an attached environment
with `NewFunctionWithEnvironment` which expects a function of the
following form:

```go
type MyEnvironment struct {
	shift int32
}

environment := &MyEnvironment {
	shift: 42,
}

hostFunction := wasmer.NewFunction(
	store,

	// The host function signature.
	wasmer.NewFunctionType(
		wasmer.NewValueTypes(wasmer.I32, wasmer.I32), // two i32 params
		wasmer.NewValueTypes(wasmer.I32), // one i32 result
	),

	// Our environment!
	environment,

	// The function implementation.
	func(environment interface{}, args []wasmer.Value) ([]wasmer.Value, error) {
		// Cast to our environment type, and do whatever we want!
		env := environment.(*MyEnvironment)
		e := env.shift;
		x := args[0].I32()
		y := args[1].I32()

		return []wasmer.Value{wasmer.NewI32(e + x + y)}, nil
	},
)
```

The biggest improvement is that the environment can be anything! No
more restriction due to `cgo`. The user is free to store anything
needed.

### A word about exported functions

The `Exports` API provides the following methods: `GetFunction`,
`GetMemory`, `GetGlobal` and `GetMemory`, to get an export by its
name.

`GetFunction` returns an exported function with a native Go API,
i.e. a function that can be invoked as `addOne(42)`. It's actually an
alias of `GetRawFunction(name).Native()` (including error handling):

- A _raw function_ is represented by the type `Function`,
- A _native function_ is represented by the type `NativeFunction`.

The `Function` type provides more information about the function
itself, whilst `NativeFunction` serves the purpose of being easy to
use as any Go functions.

```go
addOne, _ := instance.Exports.GetRawFunction("add_one")

fmt.Println(addOne.Type())
fmt.Println(addOne.ParameterArity())
fmt.Println(addOne.ResultArity())

result, _ := addOne.Call(41)
// or
addOneNative := addOne.Native()
result, _ := addOneNative(41)
```

This example illustrates that even if the new API is more idiomatic,
it's not without being less expressive or losing features.

## Compilers and Engines

Let's talk for a moment about compilers and engines. Compilers aim at
compiling WebAssembly modules into executable code. Engines drive the
compilation _and_ the execution of the WebAssembly modules. This
design provides unique flexibility which allows Wasmer to be used in
various contexts.

### Cranelift has new companions: Singlepass and LLVM!

The Wasmer runtime provides 3 compilers to compile the WebAssembly
modules into executable codes:

- Singlepass: Super fast compilation times, slow execution times. Not
  prone to JIT-bombs,
- Cranelift: Fast compilation times, fast execution times,

- LLVM: Slow compilation times, very fast execution times (close to
  native).

Previously, `wasmer-go` was providing only one compiler:
Cranelift. However, a non-negligible population of our users run small
WebAssemby modules. In that specific case, execution time is not an
issue since it will always be quick, however we must improve the
compilation time. And that's why we are happy to announce that
`wasmer-go` now embeds the Singlepass compiler too by default!

Double announcement: When execution performance really matters to you,
you can now use the LLVM compiler too! Even if the default
`libwasmer`s embedded inside `wasmer-go` does not provide a support
for LLVM _yet_ (we are working on it), the entire API already supports
it. It is really easy to use your own custom `libwasmer` that includes
LLVM and build against it (see below about the `custom_wasmer_runtime`
tag).

Cranelift will continue to be the default compiler. To change that
behaviour, one needs to create a new configuration for the engine and
use `Config.UseSinglepassCompiler` or `Config.UseLLVMCompiler`:

```go
// Configure the engine to use the Singlepass compiler.
config := wasmer.NewConfig().UseSinglepassCompiler()
engine := wasmer.NewEngineWithConfig(config)

// Compile the WebAssembly module.
store := wasmer.NewStore(engine)
module, _ := wasmer.NewModule(store, wasmBytes)

// Instantiate it, and something with it.
instance, _ := wasmer.NewInstance(module, wasmer.NewImportObject())
```

It's that simple!

Note: The new `IsCompilerAvailable` function might be your best friend to
test whether a compiler is available.

### JIT and Native engines

The Wasmer runtime also provides 3 engines to compile _and_ to execute
WebAssembly modules. Let's only keep 2 engines in this article. In a
nutshell:

- The JIT engine stores the executable code in memory,

- The Native engine stores the executable code in a native shared
  library object (`.so`, `.dylib`, or `.dll` files depending on the
  Operating System it runs),

Previously, `wasmer-go` only provided the JIT engine. Now, it's our
pleasure to announce that the Native engine is now also part of the
family!

Note: The Native engine doesn't work with the Singlepass compiler yet.

The difference between the engines is in how the executable code is
stored, especially when serializing and deserializing a compiled
WebAssembly module; let's see:

```go
// Configure the engine to use the Cranelift compiler with the Native
// engine.
config := wasmer.NewConfig().UseCraneliftCompiler().UseNativeEngine()
engine := wasmer.NewEngineWithConfig(config)

// Compile the WebAssembly module.
store := wasmer.NewStore(engine)
module, _ := wasmer.NewModule(store, wasmBytes)

// It's time to save this compiled WebAssembly module!
serializedModule, _ := module.Serialize()
_ := ioutil.WriteFile("my_wasm_module.so", serializedModule, 0644)

// … later… in another galaxy, far far away…

serializedModule, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("my_wasm_module.so")
module, _ := wasmer.DeserializeModule(store, serializedModule)

// And instantiate it!
instance, _ := wasmer.NewInstance(module, wasmer.NewImportObject())
```

Deserializing a compiled WebAssembly module with the Native engine is
generally faster as it requires fewer operations.

## Cross-compilation

The engines and the compilers have a new, very interesting feature:
They can cross-compile. This means that from machine A with a certain
CPU, it is possible to compile for another machine B with a different
CPU. To do this we are introducing the `Target`, `Triple` and
`CpuFeatures` API.

Let's say we are on a `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` machine, and we want
to compile for an `x86_64-apple-darwin` machine:

```go
// Let's declare the triple of the machine we want to compile for.
triple, _ := wasmer.NewTriple("x86_64-apple-darwin")

// Let's configure the CPU features.
cpuFeatures := wasmer.NewCpuFeatures()
cpuFeatures.Add("sse2")

// Finally, a Target is a pair composed of a Triple and CPU features.
target := wasmer.NewTarget(triple, cpuFeatures)
```

After that, we pass the `Target` to the `Config` API, we compile the
WebAssembly module, and save it:

```go
// Compile for a specific target.
config := wasmer.NewConfig().UseTarget(target)

// Create the engine with a specific configuration.
engine := wasmer.NewEngineWithConfig(config)
store := wasmer.NewStore(engine)

// Let's compile the module for the given target.
module, _ := wasmer.NewModule(store, wasmBytes)

// Serialize the compiled module.
ioutil.Writefile("my_wasm_module.wjit", module.Serialize(), 0644)
```

The serialized compiled module can be then deserialized on the
targeted machine, instantiated, and executed!

That way, it is easier to pre-compile any WebAssembly modules for a
variety of machines!

## WASI

The `wasmer-go` package now features
[WASI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi) (The WebAssembly System
Interface) support with all the snapshot previews (that is, all the
versions).

First, the `GetWasiVersion` function can be used to know which version
of WASI a WebAssembly module is using or whether it's not using WASI
at all:

```go
module, _ := wasmer.NewModule(store, wasmBytes)

fmt.Println(GetWasiVersion(module))
```

Second, to setup WASI, we start by creating a `WasiEnvironment` with
the help of the `NewWasiStateBuilder` API. We then use the generated
`WasiEnvironment` object to generate an `ImportObject`. This contains
all the imports that “bridge” the WebAssembly module to the host to
make WASI a reality. Of course, it's possible to use this
`ImportObject` to import your own host functions, memories etc., just
like with any other `ImportObject`. `WasiEnvironment` is also
responsible for redirecting the `stdout` and `stderr` streams if they
are captured.

Let's see this with an example. We want to execute [this Rust
program](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/blob/794da4bc5618f7e5f8e6f046d765033372763824/wasmer/testdata/wasi.rs),
that prints its arguments, its environment variables, and that lists
the contents of its current working directory.

```go
engine := wasmer.NewEngine()
store := wasmer.NewStore(engine)
module, _ := wasmer.NewModule(store, wasmBytes)

// We specify the program name: `test-program`. We also specify the
// program is invoked with the `--test` argument, in addition to two
// environment variables: `COLOR` and `APP_SHOULD_LOG`. Finally, we map
// the `the_host_current_directory` to the current directory.
wasiEnv, _ := wasmer.NewWasiStateBuilder("wasi-test-program").
	Argument("--test")
	Environment("COLOR", "true")
	Environment("APP_SHOULD_LOG", "false")
	MapDirectory("the_host_current_directory", ".").
	CaptureStdout()
	Finalize()

// Get the import object (WASI version is auto-detected)!
importObject, _ := wasiEnv.GenerateImportObject(store, module)

// Finally, let's instantiate the module.
instance, _ := wasmer.NewInstance(module, importObject)
```

At this step, the WebAssembly module is ready to be executed. Which
exported function should be called from the instance to start the
program? Think no longer, and let's use
`Exports.GetWasiStartFunction`:

```go
start, _ := instance.Exports.GetWasiStartFunction()
start()
```

Did you notice that `stdout` is expected to be captured, as defined
by `CaptureStdout` above? Well, here is its content:

```go
stdout := string(wasiEnv.ReadStdout())

fmt.Println(stdout)
```

It prints:

```
Found program name: `wasi_test_program`
Found 1 arguments: --test
Found 2 environment variables: COLOR=true, APP_SHOULD_LOG=false
Found 1 preopened directories: DirEntry("/the_host_current_directory")
```

If `CaptureStdout` isn't called, or if `InheritStdout` is called (its
opposite function), the `stdout` stream from Go will be used
transparently.

## Ready to use on major platforms and architectures

One of the promises of WebAssembly is its _universality_. By design, it
aims at being run anywhere.

`wasmer-go` embeds the Wasmer runtime as native shared object library
(`.so`, `.dylib` etc.) for the following platforms:

- Linux on `amd64`,
- Linux on `arm64`,
- Darwin on `amd64`.

More is coming very soon, like Windows, Linux with `musl`, and more!

If you want to use a custom configuration of Wasmer, we've got you
covered with the `custom_wasmer_runtime` build tag.

```bash
$ # Configure cgo.
$ export CGO_CFLAGS="-I/path/to/include/"
$ export CGO_LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,/path/to/lib/ -L/path/to/lib/ -lwasmer_go"
$ 
$ # Run the tests to check everything is correct.
$ go test -tags custom_wasmer_runtime
```

## Conclusion

The 1.0 version is more than performance improvements: it provides a
stable and powerful API that fulfills more people's needs. We believe
that the new API design, the 2 compilers, and the 2 engines are great
improvements that provide more power and flexibility than ever before.

And with the help of the new cross-compilation API, we believe that
it's now easier than ever to execute WebAssembly anywhere.

Documentation and examples have been meticulously written to help
users new to WebAssembly, as well as advanced users. We believe it
will facilitate further usage of WebAssembly in the Go ecosystem.
