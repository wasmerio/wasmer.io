            has developed a peer-to-peer application platform which allows the
            creation of applications free of proprietary cloud providers or
            centralized APIs. Developers can compose and recompose workflows,
            APIs, and services without compromising security and without relying
            on centralized intermediaries. Fluence is democratizing peer-to-peer
            computation enabling a decentralized network that provides secure
            access to public and private data sources. The Fluence stack is 100%
            open source and is maintained and governed by a community of
            developers.

          <h3>How Fluence Works</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Fluence Labs has developed a peer-to-peer application platform that
            offers highly flexible and broad methods for building applications.
            Developers can compose and recompose workflows, APIs, and services
            without compromising security or relying on a centralized
            intermediary. Backend services hosted on the platform become
            building blocks for higher-level services that deliver new customer
            experiences without redeploying anything. Developers use a radically
            simple method for creating applications that share users, data and
            are rewarded based on application and service utilization. The
            system supports a small set of security primitives that correspond
            to π-Calculus operations, delivering on the promise of sandboxing
            and security without strict boundaries.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            At its core, the platform comprises a set of software components
            known as Aquamarine. Aqua is a composition language and interpreter
            that allows developers to compose their applications as a workflow.
            The system leverages the principles of π-Calculus; it expresses,
            coordinates, and executes programs concurrently on a single-use
            logical network with Marine, a WebAssembly runtime based on Wasmer.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h3>Fluence in Action</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            A major Fluence Labs customer is leveraging the Fluence Platform to
            create a messaging application with open source services hosted
            within Marine. Fluence enables customers and customer's customers to
            deploy chat backends within the network. Two tiers of customers host
            their nodes and servers wherever they like and seamlessly
            participate in the global chat network. WebAssembly-based API
            wrappers provide sandboxed access to external data and resources.
            These external resources can be consumed within the messaging app
            and become a part of the user experience.

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Realizing the promise of improving connectivity, countless networks,
            software solutions, and real-world connected devices, Fluence Labs
            discovered the need for a composability and integration layer. To
            deliver, the company needed to:

          <br></br>
          <ul className={`text-left ${styles.openlist}`}>
            <li>
              Determine how to realistically compose new capabilities using the
              existing capabilities of two different open networks
            </li>
            <li>
              Normalize the difference between various APIs written in multiple
              languages
            </li>
            <li>
              Handle infrastructure heterogeneity between nodes in a network
            </li>
            <li>
              Enable their customers to create pragmatic, performant, and secure
              solutions at scale.

          </ul>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Given the complexity that Fluence needed to abstract, the Fluence
            team placed a heavy bet on WebAssembly. Initially, Java-heavy bias
            led Fluence down the path of compiling WebAssembly bytecode into
            Java bytecode for the JVM. However, the team quickly realized the
            limitations of this approach and the future potential for
            WebAssembly. As a result, the company ultimately settled on Wasmer
            as the server-side runtime for WebAssembly applications.

          <h3>Why Wasmer</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Fluence carefully considered different runtimes as options for
            running server-side WebAssembly. Ultimately, Wasmer was selected as
            the company's default WebAssembly Runtime. Its support for language
            integrations and LLVM, closely aligned with Fluence's need to expand
            and normalize APIs across many languages. In addition to Wasmer's
            technical alignment with Fluence's vision, the company also cited
            superior community support and team responsiveness as deciding
            factors.

              "The most important advantage of using Wasmer is support and the
              Wasmer team. The level of support Wasmer provides would be
              difficult with other runtimes and wouldn't result in the same type
              of value that Wasmer can provide the community."
