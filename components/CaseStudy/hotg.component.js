            An explosion of raw data from semi-connected, highly distributed IoT
            devices and microcontrollers require an entirely new machine
            learning (ML) approach.{' '}

            brings machine-learning operations to the Edge with Tiny ML. It
            enables developers and data scientists to orchestrate ML
            applications across mesh networked edge devices, wrangle complex
            data, and train ML models on resource-constrained devices without
            compromising privacy. The company is on a mission to accelerate the
            future of hardware and Tiny ML through an open-source development
            model and community.

          <h3>How HOT-G Works</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            The HOT-G platform comprises four powerful tools, including Rune,
            Anvil, Hammer, and Saga.{' '}
            <span className={`${styles.important}`}>Rune </span>enables Tiny ML
            applications to execute in ultra-portable containers and works in
            tandem with <span className={`${styles.important}`}>Anvil</span>, a
            configuration management system that targets various devices or
            nodes. Within the Tiny ML context, devices or nodes include anything
            from small Arduinos, iOS or Android devices, and browsers. Rune
            containers must execute predictably across all target endpoints.{' '}
            <span className={`${styles.important}`}>Hammer,</span> the
            deployment engine, runs and manages applications on physical devices
            and relies on <span className={`${styles.important}`}>Saga</span> to
            handle scale, resiliency, observability, and data management.

              </a>
            </span>{' '}
            a London based Tech start focused on helping businesses that operate
            in low level bandwidth environments to connect their people,
            customers, process and data via a programmable platform approach to
            service consumption. With a specific focus on the maritime industry,
            as shipping operators, government agencies and environmentalists are
            heavily reliant upon various data sets collected onboard using
            various sensors that may not be able to leverage Machine Learning
            (ML) on the cloud. Key constraints include limited or no network
            connectivity whilst at sea, limiting data storage, CPU, and memory
            resources. The HOT-G team is building a solution that deploys
            Rune-based Tiny ML applications on FrontMâ€™s platform for their
            customers at sea. These ML applications are able to operate without
            needing access to the cloud. With this approach once network
            connection is within range, tagged data is offloaded to train new
            models. Model updates can then be published and shared across the
            fleet.

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Edge computing, in general, compounds application orchestration
            challenges compared to traditional data center or cloud computing
            environments. In addition to extreme latency, heterogeneous
            infrastructure, and security concerns, HOT-G must also handle
            specialized ML requirements.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <ul className={`text-left ${styles.openlist}`}>
            <li>
              The ability to securely provide access to local or highly
              specialized hardware (e.g., sensors, TPUs, FPGAs, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Portability of Tiny ML applications that run predictably across
              many types of infrastructure
            </li>
            <li>
              Local reproducibility of Tiny ML applications to verify resource
              footprint to predetermine execution probability on
              resource-limited devices.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            HOT-G required a solution for creating a container with universal
            execution, out-of-the-box sandboxing and security, and the ability
            to interface with low-level hardware. Their team tried several
            solutions like Emscripten and LLVM. However, they found the tight
            coupling between Emscripten and browsers a non-starter to their edge
            deployment needs. Ultimately, the team at HOT-G selected the Wasmer
            runtime for edge execution for WebAssembly.

          <h3>Why Wasmer</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            HOT-G carefully considered different interpreters and runtimes as
            options for running server-side WebAssembly. Interpreters presented
            a larger payload for smaller IoT devices, and the team found them
            challenging to work with and extend. Wasmer provided HOT-G with a
            lightweight runtime and multiple compilation options. Tooling to
            precompile WebAssembly to architecture-specific formats enables
            HOT-G to write once and deploy anywhere without any runtime
            overhead. Additional applications like WAPM, Wasmer's WebAssembly
            Package manager help HOT-G realize its open-source community-driven
            mission for Tiny ML.
