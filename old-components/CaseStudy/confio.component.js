            is creating secure permissionless infrastructure and developer tools
            for decentralized blockchain applications. As a member of the Cosmos
            Network, an ecosystem dedicated to connected decentralized apps,
            Confio is a prominent contributor to several significant open-source
            projects. Contributions include:

            The company's open-source contributions towards a trusted
            decentralized future are impressive. Equally as remarkable is their
            effort to drive mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies among
            traditional financial institutions. However, enabling financial
            institutions with blockchain isn't an easy feat. For instance, large
            financial institutions often see the dark side of cryptocurrency and
            require a lot of education to understand the value a blockchain can
            provide their business. In addition to helping companies overcome
            their fear of the unknown, Confio is creating solutions like Tgrade
            to remediate regulatory challenges and drive adoption. Tgrade is the
            most secure blockchain backed by Proof-of-Engagement governance,
            which successfully enables DeFi or decentralized finance.
          </p>

          <h3>How Confio Solutions Work</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            CosmWasm, IBC, and CosmJS are foundational for many blockchains and
            decentralized applications in the Cosmos ecosystem. They provide
            critical smart contract, communications, and integrations components
            for enabling{' '}

            >
              Tgrade.
            </a>{' '}
            Tgrade further enables the next generation of multi-chain
            applications. Interestingly, Tgrade works based on self-sovereign
            groups. Meaning Tgrade customers that have an off-chain relationship
            with one another can create Trusted Circles. Tgrade facilitates the
            exchange of value between self-sovereign groups and group members.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Another critical area of innovation for Confio is private key
            management. Preventing keys from being stolen and enabling safe
            backups are two issues Confio is solving. The company is creating a
            multi-factor authentication/authorization approach allowing mobile
            phones to co-sign private keys. Confios innovative approach makes it
            very easy to build and deploy decentralized software, pushing logic
            higher up the stack. Once applications are up and running, adding
            new functionality is facilitated by deploying smart contracts
            without stopping any of the participating nodes.

            At its core, the platform comprises a set of software components
            known as Aquamarine. Aqua is a composition language and interpreter
            that allows developers to compose their applications as a workflow.
            The system leverages the principles of Ï€-Calculus; it expresses,
            coordinates, and executes programs concurrently on a single-use
            logical network with Marine, a WebAssembly runtime based on Wasmer.

          <br></br>
          <p>
            CosmWasm is supporting fourteen different Cosmos projects, including
            Terra, Regen Network, and Crypto.com, to name a few. The company's
            contributions to the Cosmos Network streamlines the development of
            otherwise complicated decentralized infrastructure and application
            development. Building on top of a solid community-first approach,
            the company entered a strategic partnership agreement with
            Tendermint to fuel its DeFi product strategy with Tgrade. Tendermint
            leverages Tgrade to enable their vision for a token economy on
            public blockchains.

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Blockchains enable simple, transparent, and secure transactions.
            However, the distributed nature of the blockchain creates several
            challenges for blockchain applications and infrastructure providers.
            For example, a smart contract is a program that must execute
            arbitrary logic to determine if the conditions for a value exchange
            were met. In a permissionless framework for decentralized
            applications, the system must provide security guarantees.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <ul className={`text-left ${styles.openlist}`}>
            <li>
              Ensuring that a malicious or poorly written smart contract doesn't
              crash or block transaction processing for all blockchain users.
              (JIT-bombs)
            </li>
            <li>
              Supporting determinism for smart contracts on heterogeneous
              infrastructure (different chipsets and platforms must run a given
              same smart contract in the same way)
            </li>
            <li>
              Scaling the number of smart contract executions as the number of
              blocks in a blockchain increases
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Given the complexity that Confio needed to abstract, their team
            placed a calculated bet on WebAssembly and Wasmer as their
            server-side WebAssembly runtime.
          </p>
          <br></br>
        </div>
        <div className={`text-left ${styles.caseStudyBottom}`}>
          <h3>Why Wasmer</h3>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Confio's smart contracts allow blockchain developers to add new
            functionality to their blockchain at runtime. The engineering team
            at Confio quickly realized that some containerization and sandboxing
            technology were required to ensure the host machine's safety.
            WebAssembly was a natural choice since one of its core features is
            default sandboxing. WebAssembly applications require explicit
            permission and interfaces to access host machine data and resources.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Once the team settled on WebAssembly, the choice for creating a new
            server-side runtime or using an existing technology was critical.
            Confio evaluated many different backend solutions, and one of its
            early experiments included Wasmer due to its support for the Go
            programming language. Confio's need to support Go modules and
            Wasmer's support for multiple languages, including Go, made it an
            ideal solution. Eventually, the company decided to migrate all of
            its source code to Rust. During the development process, the company
            periodically revisited emerging and evolving backend runtimes and on
            Wasmer and its ecosystem.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Over time Confio built their solution around Wasmer to enable
            various layers of caching. Wasmer allowed the team to compile
            something once, cache it, and run it as many times as they needed.
            For example, token contracts used by many people compile once and
            enable the community to leverage the precompiled contract in memory
            and run it over and over again.
